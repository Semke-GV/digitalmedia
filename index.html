    <h1>Hi I'm Semke! </h1>
    <p> I'm a freshman at Eleanor Roosevelt High School in NYC, and I was born n raised in Jackson Heights, Queens. Some of my interests are math, sleeping, and spending time with my friends and family. I enjoy my digital media class because of my goat teacher Mr. Zeng. Currently, we're learning how to code our own fun websites using HTML and CSS code.
